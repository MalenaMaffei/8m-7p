Such techniques are very effective in reducing the burstiness of the bandwidth requirements for transmitting compressed, stored video. This paper addresses online bandwidth smoothing for a growing number of streaming video applications such as newscasts, sportscasts, and distance learning, where many clients may be willing to tolerate a playback delay of a few seconds in exchange for a smaller bandwidth requirement. The smoothing can be performed at either the source of the videocast or at special smoothing server(s) (e.g., proxies or gateways) within the network. In contrast to previous work on stored video, the online smoothing server has limited knowledge of frame sizes and access to only a segment of the video at a time. This is either because the feed is live or because it is streaming past the server. We formulate an online smoothing model which incorporates playback delay, client and server buffer sizes, server processing capacity, and frame size prediction techniques. Our model can accommodate an arbitrary arrival process. Using techniques for smoothing stored video at the source as a starting point, we develop an online, window-based smoothing algorithm for delay tolerant applications. Extensive experiments with MPEG-1 and M-JPEG video traces demonstrate that online smoothing significantly reduces the peak rate, coefficient of variation, and effective bandwidth of variable-bit-rate video streams. These reductions can be achieved with modest playback delays of a few seconds to a few tens of seconds and moderate client buffer sizes, and closely approximate the performance of optimal offline smoothing of stored video. In addition, we show that frame size prediction can offer further reduction in resource requirements, though prediction becomes relatively less important for longer playback delays. However, the ability to predict future frame sizes affects the appropriate division of buffer space between the server and client sites. Our experiments show that the optimal buffer allocation shifts to placing more memory at the server as the server has progressively less information about future frame sizes.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Bandwidth smoothing techniques for stored video perform end to end workahead transmission of frames into the client play...","authors":[[{"name":"Subhabrata Sen","ids":["35049639"],"slug":"Subhabrata-Sen"},{"text":"Subhabrata Sen","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Jennifer Rexford","ids":["1730356"],"slug":"Jennifer-Rexford"},{"text":"Jennifer Rexford","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Jayanta K.

Consequently, if a multicast source's transmission rate is regulated according to loss indications from receivers, the rate may be completely throttled as the number of loss paths increases. In this paper, we analyze a family of additive increase multiplicative decrease congestion control algorithms and show that, unless careful attention is paid to the LPM problem, the average session bandwidth of a multicast session may be reduced drastically as the size of the multicast group increases. This makes it impossible to share bandwidth in a max-min fair manner among unicast and multicast sessions. We show that max-min fairness can be achieved however if every multicast session regulates its rate according to the most congested end-to-end path in its multicast tree. We present an idealized protocol for tracking the most congested path under changing network conditions, and use simulations to illustrate that tracking the most congested path is indeed a promising approach.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"An important concern for source-based multicast congestion control algorithms is the loss path multiplicity (LPM) proble...","authors":[[{"name":"Supratik Bhattacharyya","ids":["145045535"],"slug":"Supratik-Bhattacharyya"},{"text":"Supratik Bhattacharyya","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Donald F.

Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP send rate and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates.

We provide a formal framework for studying broadcasting schemes and design a family of schemes for broadcasting popular videos, the greedy disk-conserving broadcasting (GDB) family. We analyze the resource requirements for GDB, i.e., the number of server broadcast channels, the client storage space, and the client I/O bandwidth required by GDB. Our analysis shows that all of our proposed broadcasting schemes are within a small factor of the optimal scheme in terms of the server bandwidth requirement. Furthermore, GDB exhibits a tradeoff between any two of the three resources. We compare our scheme with a recently proposed broadcasting scheme, skyscraper broadcasting (SB). With GDB, we can reduce the client storage space by as much as 50% or the number of server channels by as much as 30% at the cost of a small additional increase in the amount of client I/O bandwidth. If we require the client I/O bandwidth of GDB to be identical to that of SB, GDB needs only 70% of the client storage space required by SB or one less server channel than SB does. In addition, we show that with small client I/O bandwidth, the resource requirements of GDB are close to the minimum achievable by any disk-conserving broadcasting scheme.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Abstract.

A number of researchers have considered transmitting stored video from server to a client using smoothing algorithms to reduce this rate variability. These algorithms exploit client buffering capabilities and determine a \"smooth\" rate transmission schedule, while ensuring that a client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. We investigate how video smoothing impacts the statistical multiplexing gains available with such traffic, and we show that a significant amount of statistical multiplexing gains can still be achieved. We then examine the implication of these results on network resource management and call admission control when transmitting smoothed stored video using VBR service with statistical quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. Specifically, we present a uniform call admission control scheme based on a Chernoff bound method that uses a simple, novel traffic model requiring only a few parameters. This scheme provides an easy and flexible mechanism for supporting multiple VBR service classes with different QoS requirements. We evaluate the efficacy of the call admission control scheme over a set of MPEG-1 coded video tracts.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Variable bit-rate (VBR) compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale rate variability.

Two basic results are presented. First, we show how to achieve the greatest possible reduction in rate variability when sending stored video to a client with given buffer size. We formally establish the optimality of our approach and illustrate its performance over a set of long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: deterministic guaranteed service (Chang 1994; Wrege et al. 1996) and renegotiated constant-bit-rate (RCBR) service (Grossglauser et al. 1997).

Such techniques are very effective in reducing the burstiness of the bandwidth requirements for transmitting compressed, stored video. This paper addresses online bandwidth smoothing for a growing number of streaming video applications such as newscasts, sportscasts, and distance learning, where many clients may be willing to tolerate a playback delay of a few seconds in exchange for a smaller bandwidth requirement. The smoothing can be performed at either the source of the videocast or at special smoothing server(s) (e.g., proxies or gateways) within the network. In contrast to previous work on stored video, the online smoothing server has limited knowledge of frame sizes and access to only a segment of the video at a time. This is either because the feed is live or because it is streaming past the server. We formulate an online smoothing model which incorporates playback delay, client and server buffer sizes, server processing capacity, and frame size prediction techniques. Our model can accommodate an arbitrary arrival process. Using techniques for smoothing stored video at the source as a starting point, we develop an online, window-based smoothing algorithm for delay tolerant applications. Extensive experiments with MPEG-1 and M-JPEG video traces demonstrate that online smoothing significantly reduces the peak rate, coefficient of variation, and effective bandwidth of variable-bit-rate video streams. These reductions can be achieved with modest playback delays of a few seconds to a few tens of seconds and moderate client buffer sizes, and closely approximate the performance of optimal offline smoothing of stored video. In addition, we show that frame size prediction can offer further reduction in resource requirements, though prediction becomes relatively less important for longer playback delays. However, the ability to predict future frame sizes affects the appropriate division of buffer space between the server and client sites. Our experiments show that the optimal buffer allocation shifts to placing more memory at the server as the server has progressively less information about future frame sizes.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Bandwidth smoothing techniques for stored video perform end to end workahead transmission of frames into the client play...","authors":[[{"name":"Subhabrata Sen","ids":["35049639"],"slug":"Subhabrata-Sen"},{"text":"Subhabrata Sen","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Jennifer Rexford","ids":["1730356"],"slug":"Jennifer-Rexford"},{"text":"Jennifer Rexford","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Jayanta K.

In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady-state send rate as a function of loss rate and round trip time (RTT) for a bulk transfer TCP flow. Unlike the models of Lakshman and Madhow (see IEE/ACM Trans. Networking, vol.5, p.336-50, 1997), Mahdavi and Floyd (1997), Mathis, Semke, Mahdavi and Ott (see Comput. Commun. Rev., vol.27, no.3, 1997) and by by Ott et al., our model captures not only the behavior of the fast retransmit mechanism but also the effect of the time-out mechanism. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more time-out events than fast retransmit events. Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP send rate and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates. We also present a simple extension of our model to compute the throughput of a bulk transfer TCP flow, which is defined as the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"The steady-state performance of a bulk transfer TCP flow (i.e., a flow with a large amount of data to send, such as FTP ...","authors":[[{"name":"Jitendra Padhye","ids":["1695132"],"slug":"Jitendra-Padhye"},{"text":"Jitendra Padhye","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Victor Firoiu","ids":["2937357"],"slug":"Victor-Firoiu"},{"text":"Victor Firoiu","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Donald F.

Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: deterministic guaranteed service (Chang 1994; Wrege et al. 1996) and renegotiated constant-bit-rate (RCBR) service (Grossglauser et al. 1997). Under both models, the impact of optimal smoothing is dramatic.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Variable-bit-rate (VBR) compressed video can exhibit significant multiple-time-scale bit-rate variability.

Such techniques are very effective in reducing the burstiness of the bandwidth requirements for transmitting compressed, stored video. This paper addresses online bandwidth smoothing for a growing number of streaming video applications such as newscasts, sportscasts, and distance learning, where many clients may be willing to tolerate a playback delay of a few seconds in exchange for a smaller bandwidth requirement. The smoothing can be performed at either the source of the videocast or at special smoothing server(s) (e.g., proxies or gateways) within the network. In contrast to previous work on stored video, the online smoothing server has limited knowledge of frame sizes and access to only a segment of the video at a time. This is either because the feed is live or because it is streaming past the server. We formulate an online smoothing model which incorporates playback delay, client and server buffer sizes, server processing capacity, and frame size prediction techniques. Our model can accommodate an arbitrary arrival process. Using techniques for smoothing stored video at the source as a starting point, we develop an online, window-based smoothing algorithm for delay tolerant applications. Extensive experiments with MPEG-1 and M-JPEG video traces demonstrate that online smoothing significantly reduces the peak rate, coefficient of variation, and effective bandwidth of variable-bit-rate video streams. These reductions can be achieved with modest playback delays of a few seconds to a few tens of seconds and moderate client buffer sizes, and closely approximate the performance of optimal offline smoothing of stored video. In addition, we show that frame size prediction can offer further reduction in resource requirements, though prediction becomes relatively less important for longer playback delays. However, the ability to predict future frame sizes affects the appropriate division of buffer space between the server and client sites. Our experiments show that the optimal buffer allocation shifts to placing more memory at the server as the server has progressively less information about future frame sizes.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Bandwidth smoothing techniques for stored video perform end to end workahead transmission of frames into the client play...","authors":[[{"name":"Subhabrata Sen","ids":["35049639"],"slug":"Subhabrata-Sen"},{"text":"Subhabrata Sen","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Jennifer Rexford","ids":["1730356"],"slug":"Jennifer-Rexford"},{"text":"Jennifer Rexford","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Jayanta K.

In the case of the analysis of the LRU policy, the computational complexity for estimating the buffer hit probability is O(KB) where B is the size of the buffer and K denotes the number of items having distinct access probabilities. In the case of the FIFO policy, the solution algorithm is iterative and the computational complexity of each iteration is O(K). Results from these models are compared to exact results for models originally developed by King [KING71] for small values of the buffer size, B, and the total number of items sharing the buffer, D. Results are also compared with results from a simulation for large values of B and D. In most cases, the error is extremely small (less than 0.1%) for both LRU and FIFO, and a maximum error of 3% is observed for very small buffer size (less than 5) when the access probabilities are extremely skewed. To demonstrate the usefulness of the model, we consider two applications. In our first application, we compare the LRU and FIFO policies to an optimal static buffer allocation policy for a database consisting of two classes of data items. We observe that the performance of LRU is close to that of the optimal allocation. As the optimal allocation requires knowledge of the access probabilities, the LRU policy is preferred when this information is unavailable. We also observe that the LRU policy always performs better than the FIFO policy in our experiments. In our second application, we show that if multiple independent reference streams on mutually disjoint sets of data compete for the same buffer, it is better to partition the buffer using an optimal allocation policy than to share a common buffer.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"In this paper, we develop approximate analytical models for predicting the buffer hit probability under the Least Recent...","authors":[[{"name":"Asit Dan","ids":["34717981"],"slug":"Asit-Dan"},{"text":"Asit Dan","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Donald F.

Similar to patching, threshold-based multicast allows two clients that request the same video to share a channel without having to delay the earlier request. It ensures sharing by permitting the client with the later arrival time to join an ongoing multicast session initiated for the earlier request. However, threshold-based multicast does not allow a later arriving client to always join an ongoing multicast session. If it has been some time since the ongoing multicast session was started, a new multicast session is initiated. That is, a threshold is used to control the frequency at which new multicast sessions are started. We derive the optimal threshold that minimizes the server bandwidth required. Our analytical result shows that threshold-based multicast significantly reduces the server bandwidth requirement.

A critical issue for such multicast applications and the higher layer protocols required to support them is the manner in which packet losses occur within the multicast network. We present and analyze packet loss data collected on multicast-capable hosts at 17 geographically distinct locations in Europe and the US and connected via the MBone. We experimentally and quantitatively examine the spatial and temporal correlation in packet loss among participants in a multicast session. Our results show that there is some spatial correlation in loss among the multicast sites. However, the shared loss in the backbone of the MBone is, for the most part, low. We find a fairly significant amount of of burst loss (consecutive losses) at most sites. In every dataset, at least one receiver experienced a long loss burst greater than 8 seconds (100 consecutive packets). A predominance of solitary loss was observed in all cases, but periodic losses of length approximately 0.6 seconds and at 30 second intervals were seen by some receivers.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"The success of multicast applications such as Internet teleconferencing illustrates the tremendous potential of applicat...","authors":[[{"name":"Maya Yajnik","ids":["2713103"],"slug":"Maya-Yajnik"},{"text":"Maya Yajnik","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"James F.

Under RLC, DTN nodes store and then forward random linear combinations of packets as they encounter other DTN nodes. We first consider the case where there is a single block of packets propagating in the network and then consider the case where blocks of K packets arrive according to a Poisson arrival process. Our performance metric of interest is the delay until the last packet in a block is delivered. We show that for the single block case, when bandwidth is constrained, applying RLC over packets destined to the same node achieves (with high probability) the minimum delay needed to deliver the block of data. We find through simulation that RLC achieves smaller block delivery delay than non-network-coded packet forwarding under bandwidth constraint, and the relative benefit increases further when buffer space within DTN nodes is limited. For the case of multiple blocks, our simulations show that RLC offers only slight improvement over the non-coded scenario when only bandwidth is constrained, but more significant improvement when both bandwidth and buffers are constrained. We remark that when the network is relatively loaded, RLC achieves improvements over non-coding scheme only if the spreading of the information is appropriately controlled.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"In this paper, we investigate the benefits of using a form of network coding known as Random Linear Coding (RLC) for uni...","authors":[[{"name":"Xiaolan Zhang","ids":["40017109"],"slug":"Xiaolan-Zhang"},{"text":"Xiaolan Zhang","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Giovanni Neglia","ids":["1715333"],"slug":"Giovanni-Neglia"},{"text":"Giovanni Neglia","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Jim Kurose","ids":["34610818"],"slug":"Jim-Kurose"},{"text":"Jim Kurose","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Don Towsley","ids":["30836864"],"slug":"Don-Towsley"},{"text":"Don Towsley","fragments":[]}]],"structuredAuthors":[{"firstName":"Xiaolan","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Zhang"},{"firstName":"Giovanni","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Neglia"},{"firstName":"Jim","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Kurose"},{"firstName":"Don","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Towsley"}],"year":{"text":"2006","fragments":[]},"venue":{"text":"2006 4th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks","fragments":[]},"citationContexts":[],"citationStats":{"citedByBuckets":[{"startKey":2006,"endKey":2006,"count":3},{"startKey":2007,"endKey":2007,"count":6},{"startKey":2008,"endKey":2008,"count":5},{"startKey":2009,"endKey":2009,"count":11},{"startKey":2010,"endKey":2010,"count":6},{"startKey":2011,"endKey":2011,"count":6},{"startKey":2012,"endKey":2012,"count":12},{"startKey":2013,"endKey":2013,"count":7},{"startKey":2014,"endKey":2014,"count":9},{"startKey":2015,"endKey":2015,"count":8},{"startKey":2016,"endKey":2016,"count":2},{"startKey":2018,"endKey":2018,"count":5},{"startKey":2019,"endKey":2019,"count":2}],"keyCitedByBuckets":[],"numCitations":82,"estNumCitations":59.344442037160846,"numReferences":15,"numKeyCitations":8,"numKeyReferences":2,"numViewableReferences":15,"keyCitationRate":0.0975609756097561,"firstCitationVelocityYear":2017,"lastCitationVelocityYear":2019},"earliestAcquisitionsDate":1412121600,"sources":["Crawler","Grobid","Grobid","Grobid","Grobid","Grobid","MAG","Unpaywall","ScienceParseMerged","ScienceParseMerged","ScienceParseMerged","ScienceParseMerged","ScienceParseMerged","IEEE","CiteSeerX","ScienceParse","ScienceParse","Anansi","ScienceParse","SPv2","Anansi","SPv2","Anansi","CiteSeerX","IEEE","Crawler","ScienceParse","ScienceParse","SPv2","SPv2","SPv2"],"journal":{"name":"2006 4th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc and Wireless Networks","pages":"1-7"},"socialLinks":[],"presentationUrls":[],"doiInfo":{"doi":"10.1109/WIOPT.2006.1666529","doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIOPT.2006.1666529"},"links":[{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1666529","linkType":"ieee"}],"primaryPaperLink":{"url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1666529","linkType":"ieee"},"alternatePaperLinks":[],"entities":[],"entityRelations":[],"blogs":[],"videos":[],"githubReferences":[],"faqs":[],"scorecardStats":[{"typeKey":"cited_by","citationRankPercent":95,"citationCount":82,"keyCitationCount":8,"score":10}],"externalContentStats":[],"fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science"]},{"id":"29d0b4f3a6746916c7f179218e48940be912d222","title":{"text":"Cast : P 2 P Patching Scheme for VoD Service","fragments":[]},"slug":"Cast-:-P-2-P-Patching-Scheme-for-VoD-Service-Guo-Suh","paperAbstract":{"text":"Providing video on demand (VoD) service over the Internet in a scalable way is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose Cast an architecture that uses a peer-to-peer approach to cooperatively stream video using patching techniques, while only relying on unicast connections among peers. We address the following two key technical issues in Cast: (1) constructing an application overlay appropriate for streaming; and (2) providing continuous stream playback (without glitches) in the face of disruption from an early departing client. Our simulation experiments show that Cast can serve many more clients than traditional client-server unicast service, and that it generally out-performs multicast-based patching if clients can cache more than of a stream’s initial portion. We handle disruptions by delaying the start of playback and applying the shifted forwarding technique. A threshold on the length of time during which arriving clients are served in a single session in Cast serves as a knob to adjust the balance between the scalability and the clients’ viewing quality in Cast.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Providing video on demand (VoD) service over the Internet in a scalable way is a challenging problem.

The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The framework has been prototyped in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, and has been extensively tested on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to more than 1000 participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided our design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery. With the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"This paper

paper describes SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast), a reliable multicast framework for application level framing and light-weight sessions. The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The framework has been prototyped in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, and has been extensively tested on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to more than 1000 participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided our design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery. With the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"This paper

avoidance in packet-switched networks. The gateway detects incipient congestion by computing the average queue size. The gateway could notify connections of congestion either by dropping packets arriving at the gateway or by setting a bit in packet headers. When the average queue size exceeds a present threshold, the gateway drops or marks each arriving packet with a certain probability, where the exact probability is a function of the average queue size. RED gateways keep the average queue size low while allowing occasional bursts of packets in the queue. During congestion, the probability that the gateway notifies a particular connection to reduce its window is roughly proportional to that connection's share of the bandwidth through the gateway. RED gateways are designed to accompany a transport-layer congestion control protocol such as TCP.

In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady-state send rate as a function of loss rate and round trip time (RTT) for a bulk transfer TCP flow. Unlike the models of Lakshman and Madhow (see IEE/ACM Trans. Networking, vol.5, p.336-50, 1997), Mahdavi and Floyd (1997), Mathis, Semke, Mahdavi and Ott (see Comput. Commun. Rev., vol.27, no.3, 1997) and by by Ott et al., our model captures not only the behavior of the fast retransmit mechanism but also the effect of the time-out mechanism. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more time-out events than fast retransmit events. Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP send rate and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates. We also present a simple extension of our model to compute the throughput of a bulk transfer TCP flow, which is defined as the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"The steady-state performance of a bulk transfer TCP flow (i.e., a flow with a large amount of data to send, such as FTP ...","authors":[[{"name":"Jitendra Padhye","ids":["1695132"],"slug":"Jitendra-Padhye"},{"text":"Jitendra Padhye","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Victor Firoiu","ids":["2937357"],"slug":"Victor-Firoiu"},{"text":"Victor Firoiu","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Donald F.

Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet explains the engineering problems that are inherent in communicating digital information from point to point. The top-down approach mentioned in the subtitle means that the book starts at the top of the protocol stack--at the application layer--and works its way down through the other layers, until it reaches bare wire. The authors, for the most part, shun the well-known seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack in favor of their own five-layer (application, transport, network, link, and physical) model. It's an effective approach that helps clear away some of the hand waving traditionally associated with the more obtuse layers in the OSI model. The approach is definitely theoretical--don't look here for instructions on configuring Windows 2000 or a Cisco router--but it's relevant to reality, and should help anyone who needs to understand networking as a programmer, system architect, or even administration guru.The treatment of the network layer, at which routing takes place, is typical of the overall style. In discussing routing, authors James Kurose and Keith Ross explain (by way of lots of clear, definition-packed text) what routing protocols need to do: find the best route to a destination. Then they present the mathematics that determine the best path, show some code that implements those algorithms, and illustrate the logic by using excellent conceptual diagrams. Real-life implementations of the algorithms--including Internet Protocol (both IPv4 and IPv6) and several popular IP routing protocols--help you to make the transition from pure theory to networking technologies. --David WallTopics covered: The theory behind data networks, with thorough discussion of the problems that are posed at each level (the application layer gets plenty of attention). For each layer, there's academic coverage of networking problems and solutions, followed by discussion of real technologies. Special sections deal with network security and transmission of digital multimedia.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Certain data-communication protocols hog the spotlight, but all of them have a lot in common.

In this paper we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most effectively toward reducing the variability of the transmitted bit rate. Two basic results are presented. First, we show how to achieve the greatest possible reduction in rate variability when sending stored video to a client with given buffer size. We formally establish the optimality of our approach and illustrate its performance over a set of long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: deterministic guaranteed service (Chang 1994; Wrege et al. 1996) and renegotiated constant-bit-rate (RCBR) service (Grossglauser et al. 1997).

In such applications, received audio packets are buffered, and their playout delayed at the destination host in order to compensate for the variable network delays. The authors investigate the performance of four different algorithms for adaptively adjusting the playout delay of audio packets in an interactive packet-audio terminal application, in the face of such varying network delays. They evaluate the playout algorithms using experimentally-obtained delay measurements of audio traffic between several different Internet sites. Their results indicate that an adaptive algorithm which explicitly adjusts to the sharp, spike-like increases in packet delay which were observed in the traces can achieve a lower rate of lost packets for both a given average playout delay and a given maximum buffer size.<<ETX>>","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Recent interest in supporting packet-audio applications over wide area networks has been fueled by the availability of l...","authors":[[{"name":"Ramachandran Ramjee","ids":["2794488"],"slug":"Ramachandran-Ramjee"},{"text":"Ramachandran Ramjee","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"James F.

We present analysis of 128 hours of end-to-end unicast and multicast packet loss measurement. From these we selected 76 hours of stationary traces for further analysis. We consider the dependence as seen in the autocorrelation function of the original loss data as well as the dependence between good run lengths and loss run lengths. The correlation timescale is found to be 1000 ms or less. We evaluate the accuracy of three models of increasing complexity: the Bernoulli model, the 2-state Markov chain model and the k-th order Markov chain model. Out of the 38 trace segments considered, the Bernoulli model was found to be accurate for 7 segments, and the 2-state model was found to be accurate for 10 segments. A Markov chain model of order 2 or greater was found to be necessary to accurately model the rest of the segments. For the case of adaptive applications which track loss, we address two issues of on-line loss estimation: the required memory size and whether to use exponential smoothing or a sliding window average to estimate average loss rate. We find that a large memory size is necessary and that the sliding window average provides a more accurate estimate for the same effective memory size.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Understanding and modelling packet loss in the Internet is especially relevant for the design and analysis of delay-sens...","authors":[[{"name":"Maya Yajnik","ids":["2713103"],"slug":"Maya-Yajnik"},{"text":"Maya Yajnik","fragments":[]}],[{"name":"Sue B.

In packet audio applications, packets are buffered at a receiving site and their playout delayed in order to compensate for variable network delays. In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptively adjusting the playout delay in order to keep this delay as small as possible, while at the same time avoiding excessive “loss” due to the arrival of packets at the receiver after their playout time has already passed. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, given a trace of packet audio receptions at a receiver, we present efficient algorithms for computing a bound on the achievable performance of any playout delay adjustment algorithm. More precisely, we compute upper and lower bounds (which are shown to be tight for the range of loss and delay values of interest) on the optimum (minimum) average playout delay for a given number of packet losses (due to late arrivals) at the receiver for that trace. Second, we present a new adaptive delay adjustment algorithm that tracks the network delay of recently received packets and efficiently maintains delay percentile information. This information, together with a “delay spike” detection algorithm based on (but extending) our earlier work, is used to dynamically adjust talkspurt playout delay. We show that this algorithm outperforms existing delay adjustment algorithms over a number of measured audio delay traces and performs close to the theoretical optimum over a range of parameter values of interest.\n","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Abstract.

As buses travel their routes, they encounter other buses and in some cases are able to establish pair-wise connections and transfer data between them. We analyze the bus-to-bus contact traces to characterize the contact process between buses and its impact on DTN routing performance. We find that the all-bus-pairs aggregated inter-contact times show no discernible pattern. However, the inter-contact times aggregated at a route level exhibit periodic behavior.Based on analysis of the deterministic inter-meeting times for bus pairs running on route pairs, and consideration of the variability in bus movement and the random failures to establish connections, we construct generative route-level models that capture the above behavior. Through trace-driven simulations of epidemic routing, we find that the epidemic performance predicted by traces generated with this finer-grained route-level model is much closer to the actual performance that would be realized in the operational system than traces generated using the coarse-grained all-bus-pairs aggregated model. This suggests the importance in choosing the rightlevel of model granularity when modelingmobility-related measures such as inter-contact times in DTNs.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"We study traces taken from UMass DieselNet, a Disruption-Tolerant Network consisting of WiFi nodes attached to buses.

In this paper, we propose P2Cast - an architecture that uses a peer-to-peer approach to cooperatively stream video using patching techniques, while only relying on unicast connections among peers. We address the following two key technical issues in P2Cast: (1) constructing an application overlay appropriate for streaming; and (2) providing continuous stream playback (without glitches) in the face of disruption from an early departing client. Our simulation experiments show that P2Cast can serve many more clients than traditional client-server unicast service, and that it generally out-performs multicast-based patching if clients can cache more than of a stream's initial portion. We handle disruptions by delaying the start of playback and applying the shifted forwarding technique. A threshold on the length of time during which arriving clients are served in a single session in P2Cast serves as a knob to adjust the balance between the scalability and the clients' viewing quality in P2Cast.","fragments":[]},"paperAbstractTruncated":"Providing video on demand (VoD) service over the Internet in a scalable way is a challenging problem.
